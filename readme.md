# AutoApply: A Python-Powered Job Hunt Assistant

A personal tool I‚Äôm building to take the pain out of job searching. It scrapes job listings, tailors my resume using templates, and logs everything I apply to .

---

## What It Does

- Scrapes job ads from selected sites
- Text Preprocessing
- Predict best match
- Fills in a resume and cover letter template automatically for job with matching percentage above 85% only
- Logs job applications in a local database
- Auto-fills and submits applications with Selenium
- Sends reminders or updates when there's no response

No LLMs, no APIs, just Python, a bit of HTML scraping, and automation.

## Why I‚Äôm Building This

This is my attempt to streamline the process and focus on the parts that actually matter like preparing for interviews and continuous upskilling.

Key Takeaway :

üîç Built as a learning project to study jobseeker behavior, optimize resume targeting, and explore real-world automation ethics.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not a spam bot. Not built for mass blind submissions. This is a **controlled, personal-use tool** focused on workflow automation and learning.

## I'm currently occupied with other priority, progress will be really slow and will only speed up starting mid of August
